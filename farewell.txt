Hello everyone! 

Very few leaders can be as successful as Mohan has been and yet remain humble honest and hard working. Mohan you always upheld the diginity of individuals and respected their point of view. I enjoyed the travelling that we did together and discussions we had on variety of topic. But never once I felt that you were judgemental, opinionated about anyone. Patience and maintaining composure in difficult situation was you hallmark which many of lose easily in todays dog eat dog world. I honestly feel lucky that I got to know you... work with you. 

Well guys, there is so much to talk about Mohan but I will pause.

Nobody has put in so much time and energy into this company than you have. You had an incredible career and all of us are proud of you. I hope you next innings would be equally rewarding and you get to do things that you have dreamed of. Stay blessed, stay healthy and thank you very much!
